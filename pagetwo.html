      <h2>The Owl House</h2>
      <p>On September 2, 2020, during a Reddit AMA, Dana Terrace confirmed that Amity is intended to be a lesbian and that Luz is bisexual.[63] The two girls represent Disney's second animated LGBTQ+ characters after Sheriff Blubbs and Deputy Derland in Gravity Falls, and the first to be unambiguously portrayed as such.[62] In the episode "Understanding Willow", one of the main characters (Willow Park) is shown to have two dads.[64] Some noted that beginning of the show's second season, which began airing in 2021, continued to build out the relationship between Amity and Luz, with Luz reciprocating Amity's feelings at the end of "Escaping Expulsion" and both blushing at each other. Others praised Amity's character evolving outside her "relationship with Luz."[18]<p>
